## Visualization and Clustering with NASA Exoplanet Data

I have a few goals and steps involved with this project:
1. Query and collect current data from NASA exoplanet archive's API;
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on key exoplanet features and generate visualizations that characterize this data;
3. Employ a clustering algorithm on the exoplanets in hopes of generating groups that resemble existing exoplanet classifications (gas giants, terrestrials);
4. Explore planet habitability using accepted facts from astronomical science, such as stellar luminosity and star-planet distance.
